## About

This Hand Gesture Detection project is designed to detect and recognize hand gestures captured by a webcam or camera feed. It uses computer vision techniques to process and analyze live video frames, identifying specific hand gestures in real-time. The recognized gestures can be used for various applications, such as sign language interpretation, remote control, and more.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software and packages installed:

- Python (version X.X.X)
- OpenCV
- Keras
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- pyttsx3 (for text-to-speech)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hand-gesture-detection.git

 ## Usage

1. Run the main application script:

   python model prediction.py

2. Ensure your webcam or camera is connected and functional.

3. The application will start capturing video from the camera.

4. Hold your hand in front of the camera and make various gestures.

5. The application will recognize and highlight the detected hand gestures in real time.

6. Press the 'Esc' key to exit the application.

## Model Training

If you want to retrain the gesture recognition model with your own dataset, follow these steps:

1. Prepare a dataset of hand gesture images, organized into folders by gesture labels.

2. Use the provided model training script:

   python train_model.py --dataset dataset_folder --model output_model.h5

   Replace `dataset_folder` with the path to your dataset and `output_model.h5` with the desired model name.

3. The script will train a deep learning model using your dataset and save the trained model to the specified file.
