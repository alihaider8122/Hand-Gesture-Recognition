## About

This Hand Gesture Detection project is designed to detect and recognize hand gestures captured by a webcam or camera feed. It uses computer vision techniques to process and analyze live video frames, identifying specific hand gestures in real-time. The recognized gestures can be used for various applications, such as sign language interpretation, remote control, and more.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software and packages installed:

- Python (version X.X.X)
- OpenCV
- Keras
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- pyttsx3 (for text-to-speech)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hand-gesture-detection.git
Change into the project directory:

sh
Copy code
cd hand-gesture-detection
Install the required Python packages:

sh
Copy code
pip install opencv-python keras tensorflow numpy pyttsx3
Usage
Run the main application script:

sh
Copy code
python hand_gesture_detection.py
Ensure your webcam or camera is connected and functional.

The application will start capturing video from the camera.

Hold your hand in front of the camera and make various gestures.

The application will recognize and highlight the detected hand gestures in real-time.

Press the 'Esc' key to exit the application.

Model Training
If you want to retrain the gesture recognition model with your own dataset, follow these steps:

Prepare a dataset of hand gesture images, organized into folders by gesture labels.

Use the provided model training script:

sh
Copy code
python train_model.py --dataset dataset_folder --model output_model.h5
Replace dataset_folder with the path to your dataset and output_model.h5 with the desired model name.

The script will train a deep learning model using your dataset and save the trained model to the specified file.

Built With
Python
OpenCV
Keras
TensorFlow
